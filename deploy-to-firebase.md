# Firebase Deployment Instructions

## Manual Deployment Steps

Since the Firebase CLI deployment is having issues, here are the manual steps to deploy your updated household manager:

### Step 1: Access Firebase Console
1. Go to: https://console.firebase.google.com/project/household-manager-acfcd/hosting/main
2. Click on "Upload files" or "Deploy from local files"

### Step 2: Upload Updated Files
Upload these files from your local `public` folder:
- `index.html` (with Google Sign-In)
- `script.js` (with household code modal)
- `styles.css` (with new styling)

### Step 3: Verify Deployment
After upload, your Firebase site should show:
- Google Sign-In button instead of email/password forms
- Household code modal after Google signup
- Profile buttons under the user name

## Alternative: Use GitHub Pages

Your GitHub Pages site should already be updated:
- **URL:** https://jamesl2026.github.io/household-manager/
